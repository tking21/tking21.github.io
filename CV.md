REASEARCH EXPERIENCE
LSU Biological Sciences 						August 2016 - Present 
Conducting research in the labs of Dr. Karen Maruska and Dr. Jeremy Brown to investigate the tradeoffs between social status and immune function while incorporating phylogenetic methods to further explore how immune related genes have contributed to the adaptive radiation of cichlids. 

Plant Sensory Systems						Sept. 2014-June 2016 
Conducting research with Dr. Michelle Price in attempts to create a plant that produces taurine, an essential organic acid that naturally occurs in meat and fish, but not plants. Taurine producing plants can then be used as a dietary supplement in human and animal diets. 

UC Davis-CBS Summer internship				June 2014-August 2014
Conducted research with Dr. Brian Moore of the University of California Davis on a simulation study that tests how well AUTEUR, a phylogenetic statistical model, is able to accurately predict the amount and value of rate shifts within phylogenies, given a continuous trait. 

The Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD)		June 2013 - August 2013
Conducted research with Dr. Thomas Hyde of LIBD examining how various co-transmitters and protein kinases within the brain are responsible for the inhibition or activation of Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter believed to be associated with schizophrenia in post mortem human brain studies.
